              Coffee is the world's favorite beverage, but the industry faces serious sustainability and fairness issues. Built on an extraction model, it often exploits cheap labor and depletes natural resources.<br><br>
              When brewing a cup, we only use less than 1% of its nutritional value. We aim to change that by unlocking the full 99%. Join us in making every cup count!

            <p class="issues-description">
              The coffee industry is worth billions, yet many coffee farmers struggle to meet their basic needs. Low prices force them to operate at a loss, unable to afford healthy diets, education, or healthcare. Sustainable practices become out of reach, and younger generations are leaving the farms behind.<br><br>
              Environmentally, current coffee production contributes to climate change, deforestation, and biodiversity loss, with water pollution and poor waste management as serious side effects. Over 99% of the coffee plant's nutritional value is wasted, with millions of tonnes of fruit pulp polluting the soil and water.<br><br>
              This calls for a circular transformation in the industry, addressing both the human and environmental costs.

    <p class="opportunities-description">
      The coffee industry holds untapped potential for a circular future. Today, less than 1% of the coffee plantâ€™s nutritional value is used, while millions of tonnes of fruit pulp are discarded, polluting the environment.<br><br>
      By reimagining how coffee is produced and consumed, this waste can be transformed into new opportunities. From reducing environmental harm to creating sustainable products, the shift toward a circular model offers a path to a more responsible and regenerative coffee industry.<br><br>
